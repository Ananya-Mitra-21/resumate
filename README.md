**Implemented JWT authentication:
POST /auth/register → Register new users (with bcrypt password hashing).
POST /auth/login → Login with username & password, returns JWT token.
GET /auth/me → Protected route to verify logged-in user.

**Frontend Auth Flow (React):
Login & Signup pages connected to backend.
Token stored in localStorage after login.
Navbar shows Login/Signup when logged out, Logout when logged in.
Resume builder access is protected → redirects to login if not authenticated.
